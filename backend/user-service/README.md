## User Service

### Quick Start

1. In the `user-service` directory, create a copy of the `.env.sample` file and name it `.env`.
2. Create a MongoDB Atlas Cluster and obtain the connection string.
3. Add the connection string to the `.env` file under the variable `DB_CLOUD_URI`.
4. Ensure you are in the `user-service` directory, then install project dependencies with `npm install`.
5. Start the User Service with `npm start` or `npm run dev`.
6. If the server starts successfully, you will see a "User service server listening on ..." message.

# User Service Guide


## Running User Service

### Local Development

1. Open Command Line/Terminal and navigate into the `user-service` directory.

2. Run the command: `npm install`. This will install all the necessary dependencies.

3. Run the command `npm start` to start the User Service in production mode, or use `npm run dev` for development mode, which includes features like automatic server restart when you make code changes.

4. Using applications like Postman, you can interact with the User Service on port 3001. If you wish to change this, please update the `.env` file.

### Docker Setup

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. In the `user-service` directory, create a copy of the `.env.docker` file if it doesn't exist and configure your environment variables.

3. Build and start the User Service with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --env-file .env.docker up --build
   ```

4. The service will be available on port 3001. To stop the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

Note: The Docker setup includes Redis for token whitelisting and uses the environment variables from `.env.docker`.

    |-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
    | 201 (Created)               | User created successfully, created user data returned |
    | 400 (Bad Request)           | Missing fields                                        |
    | 409 (Conflict)              | Duplicate username or email encountered               |
    | 500 (Internal Server Error) | Database or server error                              |

### Get User

- This endpoint allows retrieval of a single user's data from the database using the user's ID.

  > :bulb: The user ID refers to the MongoDB Object ID, a unique identifier automatically generated by MongoDB for each document in a collection.

- HTTP Method: `GET`

- Endpoint: http://localhost:3001/users/{userId}

- Parameters
    - Required: `userId` path parameter
    - Example: `http://localhost:3001/users/60c72b2f9b1d4c3a2e5f8b4c`

- <a name="auth-header">Authentication</a>
  
    - Required: Valid authentication cookies (automatically managed by browser)
    
    - Explanation: This endpoint requires the client to include JWT cookies in the HTTP request for authentication and authorization. These cookies are automatically set during the authentication process (i.e., login) and contain access tokens with information about the user's identity. The server verifies these cookies to ensure that the client is authorized to access the data.
    
    - Cookie Details:
        - `accessToken`: httpOnly cookie containing the JWT access token (15 minutes TTL)
        - `refreshToken`: httpOnly cookie containing the refresh token (7 days TTL)
        - Cookies are automatically sent by the browser with `credentials: 'include'`
    
    - Auth Rules:
    
        - Admin users: Can retrieve any user's data. The server verifies the user associated with the JWT token is an admin user and allows access to the requested user's data.
          
        - Non-admin users: Can only retrieve their own data. The server checks if the user ID in the request URL matches the ID of the user associated with the JWT token. If it matches, the server returns the user's own data.
